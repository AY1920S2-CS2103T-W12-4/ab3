Users may interact with CookBuddy through a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.

CookBuddy is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *Image reading, processing and writing*
** What it does: allows users to add images to their recipes. Images are saved in a data folder local to CookBuddy, and are named with a UID (unique identifier).
** Justification: Users should be able to see what the final dish looks like, and an image goes 
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
