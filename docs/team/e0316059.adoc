== PROJECT: CookBuddy

---

== Overview

*CookBuddy* is a desktop recipe manager for students staying in university accommodation who enjoy cooking.
They can interact with it through a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to duplicate a recipe*
** What it does: Generally the application does not allow duplicated recipe (recipes with the same names, ingredients and instructions are considered as the same). By adding duplicate command, a new recipe with the same content but a new name with perfix 'Duplicate of' can be added to the recipe list.
** Justification: This feature improves the product because a user can easily make two similar recipes by making small modification after duplication, instead of typing the whole content again.
** Highlights: The implementation allows the user to add duplicated recipe while pass the 'identical recipe' checking.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a scale recipe command that allows the user to scale their recipes by a given size.
