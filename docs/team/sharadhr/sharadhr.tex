\section{Overview}\label{overview}
\href{https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-4/main}{CookBuddy} is a desktop recipe manager for students living in on-campus accommodation, who enjoy cooking, and are also familiar with the command line.

Users may interact with CookBuddy through a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.

CookBuddy is written in Java, and has about \num{10000} lines of code.

\subsection{Enhancements Implemented}
\subsubsection{Major Enhancements}

\paragraph{Added image reading, UI display, and processing (PR \href{https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-4/main/pull/278}{\texttt{\#278}})}\label{imgcontrib}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{What it does:} Allows users to add images to their recipes, by specifying a relative or absolute
    filepath. Images are saved in a data folder local to CookBuddy, and are named with a
    UID (unique identifier). If an image cannot be found at the specified path, a placeholder is used instead.

    \item \textbf{Justification}: Users should be able to see what the final dish looks
    like, and an image goes a very long way in showing that. Furthermore, images are a prominent feature of most competing recipe managers, and we feel this is a key feature that allows CookBuddy to compete on a similar standing.

    \item \textbf{Highlights}:
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Adding reading images required a firm understanding of file I/O, as well as understanding the various Java classes in \href{https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/package-summary.html}{\texttt{java.nio.file}}.

    	Appropriate methods for easy extensibility were implemented in \href{https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/cookbuddy/commons/util/PhotographUtil.java}{\texttt{cookbuddy.commons.util.PhotographUtil}}, as well as multiple constructors in \href{https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/cookbuddy/model/recipe/attribute/Photograph.java}{\texttt{cookbuddy.model.recipe.attribute.Photograph}}.

    	\item Other file read/write methods were also implemented in \href{https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/cookbuddy/commons/util/FileUtil.java}{\texttt{cookbuddy.commons.util.FileUtil}}.

    	\item \texttt{PhotographUtil} employs the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern}{singleton pattern}, to prevent initialisation errors.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Minor Contributions}
\paragraph{Revamped the User Interface (UI) of CookBuddy (PR \href{https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-4/main/pull/179}{\texttt{\#179}}) }
\begin{itemize}
	\item A light theme was preferred by the team members
	\item \href{https://pixelduke.com/java-javafx-theme-jmetro/}{\texttt{JMetro}} was used to change the theme
	\item Appropriate classes and corresponding \texttt{.fxml} files were generated to produce the new UI.
	\item The panels of the UI were also changed, with a fixed scrolling side panel for the recipe list view, and a selected recipe overview panel.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Added Ingredient and Instruction List Attributes (PR \href{https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-4/main/pull/125}{\texttt{\#125}}) }
\begin{itemize}
	\item Ingredients and instructions were originally stored as un-delimited \texttt{String}s
	\item Classes to represent \texttt{Ingredient}s, \texttt{Instruction}s and their containers were implemented
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Minor UI and Typeface Changes to Guides (Commit \href{https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-4/main/pull/319/commits/01a9faffe83f12997f9eba13a2b92e6f4322167d}{\texttt{01a9faf}}) }

\subsection{Documentation Contributions}
\subsubsection{User Guide}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Added various feature details in \href{https://ay1920s2-cs2103t-w12-4.github.io/main/UserGuide.html#features}{\S{} 4}
	\item Added data file information in \href{https://ay1920s2-cs2103t-w12-4.github.io/main/UserGuide.html#configuration-and-recipe-data-sharadh}{\S{} 5}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Developer Guide}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{https://ay1920s2-cs2103t-w12-4.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html#design}{\S{} 5}, \href{https://ay1920s2-cs2103t-w12-4.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html#image-management-done-by-sharadh-rajaraman}{\S{} 6.2} were added, detailing the overall architecture, and the implementation of image processing (see \cref{imgcontrib}).
	\item Future work was briefly detailed in \href{https://ay1920s2-cs2103t-w12-4.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html#Implementation-Future}{\S{} 6.12};
	\item Appendices \href{https://ay1920s2-cs2103t-w12-4.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html#product-scope-done-by-zain-alam-sharadh-rajaraman}{A} and \href{https://ay1920s2-cs2103t-w12-4.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html#user-stories-done-by-sharadh-rajaraman-and-adarsh-chugani}{B} were added; in the latter, the User Stories were placed in a neat table.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Project Management and Teamwork}
\paragraph{Project Management}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Set up the organisation, repository, and initial branches for all group members
	\item Set up \texttt{Travis CI} and \texttt{AppVeyor} for initial continuous integration testing
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Teamwork}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Assisted weaker members in setting up \texttt{git} and with iP tasks
	\item Set up Zoom meetings to facilitate discussion of project proposals and code reviews, as well as implementation details
\end{itemize}
