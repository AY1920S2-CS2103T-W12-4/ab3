== PROJECT: CookBuddy

---

== Overview

*CookBuddy* is a personal desktop recipe manager application for students staying in university accommodation who enjoy cooking.
The user can interact with it through a Command Line Interface (CLI) along with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java and only supports Java 11. It also has close to 10 kLoC. With that being said, there are future plans to expand
the application to an online version as well as for different platforms.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*:
. Added a count command that allows the user to count the total number of recipes stored in CookBuddy.
** What it does: It gives the user an ability to keep track of total number of recipes stored in CookBuddy.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can know the number of recipes he/ she has. When a user have highly differentiated tastes and needs, knowing how many recipes he/ she has can let him/ her satisfy his/ her own particular wants.
** Highlights: The user is able to view the number of recipes he/ she has. This enhancement also affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Minor enhancement*:
. Added a calorie attribute to a recipe class with the necessary restraints.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=muhd97&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-02-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false[Functional code and Test code contributed]]
