== PROJECT: CookBuddy

---

== Overview

*CookBuddy* is a desktop recipe manager for students staying in university accommodation who enjoy cooking.
They can interact with it through a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability for a recipe to have a calorie*
** What it does: allows the user to add a caloric amount to a recipe.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can know the amount of calories in a recipe to meet his/ her daily caloric requirements.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a count command that allows the user to count the total number of recipes stored in CookBuddy.
