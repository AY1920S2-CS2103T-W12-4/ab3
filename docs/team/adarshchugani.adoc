== PROJECT: CookBuddy

---

== Overview

*CookBuddy* is a desktop recipe manager for students staying in university accommodation who enjoy cooking.
They can interact with it through a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to favourite/un-favourite recipes*
** What it does: allows the user to favourite or un-favourite a recipe. A recipe is marked as not favourited by
default, but the user can change this using the `fav` command. If a user wants to un-favourite a recipe, they may do
so using the `unfav` command.

* *Major enhancement #2*: implemented the `view` command
** What it does: allows users to view any recipe on the GUI. Before this feature was implemented, the displayed
recipe would always be the first recipe added in the application.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added the `done` and `undo` features, which behave similarly to the `fav` and `unfav` commands.
They are used to mark recipes as attempted and not attempted, respoectively.

* *Minor enhancement #2*: implemented the `time` command
** What it does: allows users to assign a time to a recipe. Users may exclude hours and seconds when inputting the
time, and these fields will be set to 0 if they are omitted.
