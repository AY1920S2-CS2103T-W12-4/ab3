== Introduction [Done by Zain Alam]

Welcome to CookBuddy!

For more information about using CookBuddy, consult the <<UserGuide#, CookBuddy User Guide>>.

CookBuddy is an integrated platform fully customized for users who wish to manage their recipes easily and effectively.

All your recipe information is stored on our simple and clean Graphical User Interface (GUI) with optimization for users who prefer working on a Command Line Interface (CLI).

If you are looking for a way to easily manage your recipes and have quick fingers, then CookBuddy is definitely for you!

== About this Document [Done by Zain Alam]

This document is a Developer Guide written for developers who wish to contribute to or extend our CookBuddy project.
It is technical, and explains the inner workings of CookBuddy and how the different components of our
application work together.

We have adopted a "top-down" approach in structuring our Developer Guide with first focusing at the high-level architecture of CookBuddy and then delving into the implementation details of each feature that makes up our application.

Take note of the following symbols and formatting used in this document:

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.svg[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of CookBuddy.
A quick overview of each component is given below.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit the UML diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/cookbuddy/Main.java[`Main`] and
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/cookbuddy/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to CookBuddy's log file.

The rest of CookBuddy consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of CookBuddy.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of CookBuddy in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from and writes data to the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.svg[align="center"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.svg[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/cookbuddy/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `RecipeListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework.
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/cookbuddy/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in
link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[NOTE]
====
The `UI` component uses the JMetro library to apply a theme to the default JavaFX interface. The resulting product presents a neat, Windows 10-style UI to the user, that employs https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/#/[Microsoft's Fluent Design patterns].

For more information on JMetro, refer to the https://pixelduke.com/java-javafx-theme-jmetro/[JMetro home page].
====

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.svg[align="center"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/cookbuddy/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `RecipeBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a recipe).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.svg[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.svg[align="center"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/cookbuddy/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Recipe Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Recipe>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Recipe Book`, which `Recipe` can reference. This would allow `Recipe Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Recipe` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.svg[]

==== The `attribute` package
[[attrib-package]]
.Structure of the `attribute` package, defining each `Recipe` 's key attributes
image::AttributeClassDiagram.svg[align="center"]
`attribute` defines common attributes for each recipe, such as time taken to cook, serving size, an image of the recipe, and so on.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.svg[align="center"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/cookbuddy/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component manages the recipe data, the user configuration, preferences, and the image data. To be specific, it:

* reads and writes `UserPref` objects to and from disk, as `.json` format;
* serialises, reads and writes recipe data to and from disk, _also_ as `.json` format;
* passes on the file path for the user-entered image into methods in the `ImageUtil` class. More details are given in <<Img-considerations>>.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `cookbuddy.commons` package; the three over-arching sub-packages are `core`, `exceptions`, and `util`.

==== `core`
This package defines classes for user configuration, GUI settings, and even a version number.

==== `exceptions`
This package defines exceptions thrown by CookBuddy when it encounters an error state.

==== `util`
This package defines utility classes for certain operations, like file I/O, argument validation, and image processing.




== Implementation details and Possible Enhancements

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
Some possible future components are briefly covered, and these may be released in `v2.0`.


=== Counting recipes [Done by Zain Alam]

We allow users to count the total number of recipes stored in CookBuddy. This section shows how we handle this request from the user.

==== Implementation

We store every single `Recipe` added by the user into an `ObservableList<Recipe>`, which is a list object in `UniqueRecipeList`. We used an `ObservableList` to easily reflect changes to the list by any other component of CookBuddy using the list.

The `count` command was implemented as a `CountCommand` in the `bookbuddy/logic/commands` package.

The `count` has the following input format: `count`

The following sequence diagram shows how the count operation works:

:figure-caption: Figure
.Sequence diagram of how `count` command is processed.

image::count-command/CountSequenceDiagram.svg[align="center"]

An incorrect syntax will cause a `ParseException` to be thrown by the parser.

[NOTE]
Incorrect user input will display Unknown command message.

We will now demonstrate how a `count` command works in `CookBuddy`:

Step 1. The user executes the command **count** to count the total number of recipes stored in CookBuddy.

Step 2. The input is now checked and an attempt to parse the parameter occurs. The `CountCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed.

Step 3. The method `Model#count()` will then be called to calculate the total number of recipes stored in CookBuddy.

Step 4. If successful, a success message will be generated by `CommandResult` and it will be returned with the generated
success message. Otherwise, an error message is thrown as `ParseException`.

Since the user, input in this case, is valid,
the `count` command is successfully executed and the total number of recipes currently stored in CookBuddy is displayed.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes `count` command to count the total number of recipes:

:figure-caption: Figure
.Activity diagram of executing the `count`command.
image::count-command/CountActivityDiagram.svg[align="center",650]

=== Image Management [Done by Sharadh Rajaraman]
CookBuddy allows users to add images to their recipes, which are then saved into the `data/images` folder created by CookBuddy (at least, using the default settings). This section elaborates on implementation.

The two key classes allowing image and photo management are `ImageUtil` and `Photograph`; the former is a utility class written in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern[singleton pattern]; the latter is the attribute that each `Recipe` directly contains, as <<attrib-package>> details.

==== From User Command to Image On Screen

[[img-seq]]
.Sequence Diagram of image retrieval from disk
image::PhotoSequenceDiagram.svg[align="center]

The above sequence diagram details how a user-entered command is translated to an image file as displayed on screen. Some initial details are omitted, such as the calls to `RecipeBookParser#parseCommand()` (which have already been demonstrated in <<Design-Model>>).

The steps taken are also described step-by-step in the activity diagram below:

.Activity diagram of <<img-seq>>
image::PhotoReadActivityDiagram.svg[align="center"]

==== Saving Images Into the Data Folder
When saving images, there were a few considerations that needed to be taken into account:

* The image on disk *must* contain the recipe name, so as to be reasonably understandable;

* The image on disk must be stored _losslessly_, so that repeated read-write cycles do not deplete the quality;

* If an image already exists on disk, then read/write cycles must not be wasted in overwriting an image with the same data;

* Even if recipes have the same name, the image file names must be distinct, and yet always resolve to the same.

Therefore, a hashcode is appended to each image file name, and the resulting data is saved to disk as a `.png` image, which is lossless. `jpeg` formats would require lossy compression at each save, which would progressively degrade image quality.

This entire process is also demonstrated in the activity diagram below:

.Activity diagram representing image save process
image::PhotoSaveActivityDiagram.svg[align="center"]

[[Img-considerations]]
==== Design Considerations
`ImageUtil` is implemented as a singleton class. In other words, its constructor is declared `private`, and the object can only be retrieved by the `public static` factory method, `ImageUtil.imageUtil()`. Given the class defines _several_ constants using methods, we believed this was the most straightforward direction possible.

`ImageUtil` also declares `PLACEHOLDER_IMAGE` as several static constant types: a `BufferedImage`, an `InputStream`, and even as a `Path`. The _actual_ image is bundled with the `JAR` file, which can be explored at will using an extractor tool like `7zip`.

These constants are loaded when the Photograph class is first called, thus adhering to Java's Just-In-Time (JIT) principle.

Furthermore, the initial `ImageUtil` written as an ordinary static utility class led to the JVM throwing `ExceptionInInitializerError` when the built `.jar` was run. There were no issues running this from the IDE; hence the singleton pattern.


==== Possible Improvements
As it is, image processing spans _several_ classes: `FileUtil`, `ImageUtil`, `Photograph`. We would like to simplify this. Furthermore, _saving_ image data requires returning a file path through several methods, which have little relation to one another.


// tag::FindCommandImpl[]
=== Finding recipes [Done by Kevin]

The following section describes how the `find` command is implemented as well as design considerations that were taken into account during its implementation.
Some possible future improvements are also suggested to improve the functionality of the `find` command.

The `find` command is implemented in the _FindCommand_ class.

The following activity diagram shows the possible paths *CookBuddy* can take when a `find` command is run.

.Activity diagram of finding recipes
image::FindCommandActivityDiagram.svg[align="center]

==== Implementation

. When entering the `find` command, the user will specify one attribute to search within as well as the search terms. +
   Possible attributes to search within are _name_ (`n/`), _ingredients_ (`ing/`) and _instructions_ (`ins/`).

. _FindCommandParser_ ensures that only one attribute is specified and returns a _FindCommand_ with the relevant _ContainsKeywordPredicate_ class.

The following sequence diagram summarizes the execution of the `find` command

.Sequence diagram for the execution of a `find` command
image::FindCommandSequenceDiagram.svg[align="center"]

==== Design Considerations

As the _FindCommand_ class only takes in a single _ContainsKeywordsPredicate_ object,
CookBuddy can only search within a single attribute at a time.

==== Possible improvements

As it is currently implemented, the `find` command only accepts finding via one attribute at a time.
A possible future improvement would enable it to search for recipes using multiple attributes.
This would greatly enhance the usefulness of the `find` function in *CookBuddy*.

For example, running `find n/Ham ing/toast` will make *CookBuddy* search for recipes with _Ham_ in its name, or _toast_ in its ingredients.

// end::FindCommandImpl[]


// tag::FavCommandImpl[]
=== Favouriting recipes [Adarsh]

The following section describes how the `fav` command is implemented as well as design considerations that were taken into account during its implementation.
Some possible future improvements are also suggested to improve the functionality of the `fav` command.

The `fav` command is implemented in the _FavCommand_ class.

The following activity diagram shows the possible paths *CookBuddy* can take when a `fav` command is run.

.Activity diagram of the `fav` command
image::FavActivityDiagram.svg[align="center]

==== Implementation

. When entering the `fav` command, the user will specify the index of the recipe to be favourited.

. _FavCommandParser_ ensures that index specified is valid and returns a _FavCommand_.

The following sequence diagram summarizes the execution of the `fav` command

.Sequence diagram for the execution of a `fav` command
image::FavSequenceDiagram.svg[align="center"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How many indexes should be taken in?

* Alternative 1 (Chosen): Only 1 index to be specified per use of the command

** Pros: Less error-prone
** Cons: Less efficient

* Alternative 2: Multiple indexes can be specified per use of the command

** Pros: More efficient
** Cons: More error prone




==== Possible improvements

In the current implementation, you are able to favourite recipes, even if they have already been favourited.
A possible improvement would be to notify users if the recipe they are trying to favourite has already been favourited.
This would greatly enhance the usefulness of the `fav` function in *CookBuddy*.

// end::FavCommandImpl[]


// tag::UnFavCommandImpl[]
=== Un-favouriting recipes [Adarsh]

The following section describes how the `unfav` command is implemented as well as design considerations that were taken into account during its implementation.
Some possible future improvements are also suggested to improve the functionality of the `unfav` command.

The `unfav` command is implemented in the _UnFavCommand_ class.

The following activity diagram shows the possible paths *CookBuddy* can take when a `unfav` command is run.

.Activity diagram of the `unfav` command
image::UnfavActivityDiagram.svg[align="center]

==== Implementation

. When entering the `unfav` command, the user will specify the index of the recipe to be un-favourited.

. _UnFavCommandParser_ ensures that index specified is valid and returns a _UnFavCommand_.

The following sequence diagram summarizes the execution of the `unfav` command

** Pros: Less error-prone
** Cons: Less efficient

* Alternative 2: Multiple indexes can be specified per use of the command

** Pros: More efficient
** Cons: More error prone

==== Possible improvements

In the current implementation, you are able to un-favourite recipes, even if they are not favourited.
A possible improvement would be to notify users if the recipe they are trying to favourite has not been favourited.
This would greatly enhance the usefulness of the `find` function in *CookBuddy*.

// end::UnFavCommandImpl[]


// tag::DoneCommandImpl[]
=== Marking recipes as done [Adarsh]

The following section describes how the `done` command is implemented as well as design considerations that were taken into account during its implementation.
Some possible future improvements are also suggested to improve the functionality of the `done` command.

The `done` command is implemented in the _DoneCommand_ class.

The following activity diagram shows the possible paths *CookBuddy* can take when a `done` command is run.

.Activity diagram of the `done` command
image::DoneActivityDiagram.svg[align="center]

==== Implementation

. When entering the `done` command, the user will specify the index of the recipe to be mared as done.

. _DoneCommandParser_ ensures that index specified is valid and returns a _DoneCommand_.

The following sequence diagram summarizes the execution of the `done` command

.Sequence diagram for the execution of a `done` command

** Pros: Less error-prone
** Cons: Less efficient

* Alternative 2: Multiple indexes can be specified per use of the command

** Pros: More efficient
** Cons: More error prone

==== Possible improvements

In the current implementation, you are able to mark recipes as done, even if they are already marked as done.
A possible improvement would be to notify users if the recipe they are trying to favourite has already been marked as done.
This would greatly enhance the usefulness of the `done` function in *CookBuddy*.

// end::DoneCommandImpl[]


// tag::UndoCommandImpl[]
=== Un-marking recipes as done [Adarsh]

The following section describes how the `undo` command is implemented as well as design considerations that were taken into account during its implementation.
Some possible future improvements are also suggested to improve the functionality of the `undo` command.

The `undo` command is implemented in the _UndoCommand_ class.

The following activity diagram shows the possible paths *CookBuddy* can take when a `undo` command is run.

.Activity diagram of the `undo` command
image::UndoActivityDiagram.svg[align="center]

==== Implementation

. When entering the `undo` command, the user will specify the index of the recipe to be un-favourited.

. _UndoCommandParser_ ensures that index specified is valid and returns a _UndoCommand_.

The following sequence diagram summarizes the execution of the `undo` command

.Sequence diagram for the execution of a `undo` command
image::UndoSequenceDiagram.svg[align="center"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How many indexes should be taken in?

* Alternative 1 (Chosen): Only 1 index to be specified per use of the command

** Pros: Less error-prone
** Cons: Less efficient

* Alternative 2: Multiple indexes can be specified per use of the command

** Pros: More efficient
** Cons: More error prone

==== Possible improvements

In the current implementation, you are able to mark recipes as not attempted, even if they have not been marked as attempted.
A possible improvement would be to notify users if the recipe they are trying to unmark as done has not been attempted.
This would greatly enhance the usefulness of the `undo` function in *CookBuddy*.

// end::UndoCommandImpl[]


// tag::ViewCommandImpl[]
=== Viewing recipes [Adarsh]

The following section describes how the `view` command is implemented as well as design considerations that were taken into account during its implementation.
Some possible future improvements are also suggested to improve the functionality of the `view` command.

The `view` command is implemented in the _ViewCommand_ class.

The following activity diagram shows the possible paths *CookBuddy* can take when a `view` command is run.

.Activity diagram of the `view` command
image::ViewActivityDiagram.svg[align="center]

==== Implementation

. When entering the `view` command, the user will specify the index of the recipe that they wish to view.

. _ViewCommandParser_ ensures that index specified is valid and returns a _ViewCommand_.

The following sequence diagram summarizes the execution of the `view` command

.Sequence diagram for the execution of a `view` command
image::ViewSequenceDiagram.svg[align="center"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How should the user specify the recipe they want to view

* Alternative 1 (Chosen): Using the index of the recipe

** Pros: Easily identified from the GUI
** Cons: -

* Alternative 2: Using the name of the recipe

** Pros: Users may know the name of the recipe better than the index
** Cons: Less efficient

==== Possible improvements

In the current implementation, the `view` command only takes in the index of the recipe.
A possible improvement would be to allow users to input the recipe name they want viewed.
That way, users can input either the recipe name or index.

// end::ViewCommandImpl[]


// tag::TimeCommandImpl[]
=== Assigning a time to a recipe [Adarsh]

The following section describes how the `time` command is implemented as well as design considerations that were taken into account during its implementation.
Some possible future improvements are also suggested to improve the functionality of the `time` command.

The `time` command is implemented in the _TimeCommand_ class.

The following activity diagram shows the possible paths *CookBuddy* can take when a `time` command is run.

.Activity diagram of the `time` command
image::TimeActivityDiagram.svg[align="center]

==== Implementation

. When entering the `time` command, the user will input the index of the recipe they wish to assign a time, as well as the time they wish to assign to the recipe. The time is to be in the following format (hh:MM:ss). Minutes and seconds are optional, and would be set to 0 if no values are provided for them.

. _TimeCommandParser_ ensures that index specified is valid and returns a _TimeCommand_.

The following sequence diagram summarizes the execution of the `time` command

.Sequence diagram for the execution of a `time` command
image::TimeSequenceDiagram.svg[align="center"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Should the minutes and seconds be mandatory inputs

* Alternative 1 (Chosen): No, they can be optional inputs

** Pros: More efficient
** Cons: -

* Alternative 2: Yes, they should be mandatory inputs

** Pros: -
** Cons: Much less efficient

==== Possible improvements

In the current implementation, we are parsing the hours, minutes and seconds as integers.
A possible improvement would be to use the java.util.time class.

// end::TimeCommandImpl[]



=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application may be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

[[Implementation-Future]]
=== Features coming in `v2.0`
We have some exciting features in line for `v2.0`, and some of these include:

* Converting between units: American users of our application might be more comfortable with pounds, quarts, gallons and such. Therefore, we aim to implement a seamless conversion between US customary and metric units, with a one-command (or click) way to switch between the two.

* We also note that users may prefer some advanced UNIX-style compressed syntax; hence, we are exploring using the https://picocli.info/[PicoCLI] library to implement _both_ the current Windows-style slash-based syntax, as well as UNIX-style dash-based syntax. This is a _single_ class that can either be imported as a dependency, or directly included as source.
+
We expect that this change would also drastically decrease code length and improve stability and testability, given the current implementation spans not just several _classes_, but two entire _packages_: `cookbuddy.logic.parser`, and `cookbuddy.logic.command`. As it is now, we have needless object-orientation for the sake of doing so, and we believe in simplicity as much as possible.

* We understand users who cook love to share their creations with friends and family; therefore, we intend to use social media APIs from Facebook, Google, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, and Snapchat, to allow users to share their recipes to the world.

* Users might not be comfortable with keeping their computers near the stove, hence, we plan to offer two solutions in `v2.0`:
** We plan to release mobile apps for the two major platforms, Android and iOS.
** For users more comfortable with paper, we plan to allow _printing_ of recipes to PDF, and directly to printers. This engine is intended to be powered by `LaTeX`.
