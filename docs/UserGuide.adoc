The recipe data is stored in the specified path above, as _another_ `.json` file, with key-value pairs.

[WARNING]
====
Do *_not_* edit the `recipebook.json` file by hand, nor delete any lines from the file. CookBuddy may fail to read the file and may crash, or worse, overwrite the file with placeholder data.

The file may be copied out elsewhere for editing, but adhere strictly to the format as written out by CookBuddy.
