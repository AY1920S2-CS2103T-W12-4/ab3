== Introduction

This user guide provides documentation on CookBuddy such as a quick start guide and an overview of its features.

*CookBuddy* is for users who prefer a desktop application for managing recipes.
More importantly, *CookBuddy* is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you are a fast typist, *CookBuddy* can manage your recipes faster than applications that use a GUI.
